# Introduction

## Introduction

* Key question: **What drove the explosive growth in venture activity?**

* **Two possible drivers:** \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){investor exuberance}} and \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node3){founder fervor}}
  - Did investors become substantially more favorable toward private startups?
  - Or, did we all become much more entrepreneurial?
  
* **Common narrative:** the bonanza in venture activity over the last decade reflects growing entrepreneurialism, the ease of starting a company, etc.
  - **Spoiler alert:** *not really*

\end{tikzpicture}

## Introduction (Cont'd)

* **Source:** PitchBook data, 2010-2022

* **Note:** Since we're focused on growth, most data is in logarithms

* All analysis done in **R**, code and data can be found here:

# Up and to the Right

## A Rising Tide Lifts All Stages

* From 2010, venture funding grew at ~25% CAGR through the 2011 peak

```{r}
ggplot(data_yr, aes(year, capital_ldl)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = series)) +
  labs(
    title    = "Growth in Funding Volume",
    x        = element_blank(),
    y        = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks   = seq(2010, 2022, 1),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 3, 0.5),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
  )
```

## Some Quick Algebra

* Can think about \$1 of invested capital as having \hlight{\textbf{three components}}
  - \# of deals
  - \$ average valuation
  - \% average dilution

```{r, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("decomp.png")
```

## Planting the Seeds

* Deal counts have ballooned across all stages, but the Seed stage stands out

```{r}
ggplot(data_yr, aes(year, deals_ldl)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = series)) +
  labs(
    title    = "Growth in Deal Activity",
    x        = element_blank(),
    y        = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks   = seq(2010, 2022, 1),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-0.1, 2.5),
    breaks = seq(0, 2.5, 0.5),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
  )
```

## Too Real

* Venture deal activity is anchored to the broader economy, especially at the late-stage

```{r}
ggplot(data_yr) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = deals_ldl, color = "Deals")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = gdp_ldl, color = "US Real GDP")) +
  facet_wrap(~series, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks   = seq(2010, 2022, 4),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-0.5, 2.5)
  ) +
  scale_color_discrete(
    labels = c("Deals", "US Real GDP")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Growth in Quarterly Deal Count vs US GDP",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25)
  )
```

## Valuation Inflation

* Valuations have grown dramatically across all stages

```{r}
ggplot(data_yr, aes(year, valuation_ldl)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = series)) +
  labs(
    title    = "Growth in Average Deal Valuation",
    x        = element_blank(),
    y        = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks   = seq(2010, 2022, 1),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 3, 0.5),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
  )
```

## Tracking the Nasdaq

* Private valuations closely track prices in the public tech market
  - Importantly, this holds true even though different companies raise capital each quarter

```{r, fig.dim=c(6, 2.5)}
ggplot(data[, lapply(.SD, \(x) x - first(x)), .SDcol = c("nasdaq_l", "valuation_l"), by = .(series)]) +
  geom_line(aes(x = data[, time, by = series]$time, y = nasdaq_l, color = "B")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = data[, time, by = series]$time, y = valuation_l, color = "A")) +
  facet_wrap(~series, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-0.5, 3.5)
  ) +
  scale_color_discrete(
    labels = c("Private Valuations", "Nasdaq")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Private Valuations vs. The Nasdaq Composite Index",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25),
  )
```


## The Evolution of Dilution

* Dilution has fallen in every stage since 2010

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.dim=c(6, 2.75), dev="cairo_pdf"}
ggplot(data_yr, aes(year, dilution_ldl)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = series)) +
  labs(
    title    = "Change in Average Dilution",
    x        = element_blank(),
    y        = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks   = seq(2010, 2022, 1),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
  )
```

## It's Valuations (Almost) All the Way Down

* Rising valuations drove most funding growth across stages

```{r}
ggplot(melt(data_yr[, c("year", "series", "deals_ldl", "valuation_ldl", "dilution_ldl")], measure = patterns("_ldl")), aes(x = year, y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity", width = 0.85, size = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~series, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks   = seq(2010, 2022, 4),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(-1, 4, 1),
    limits = c(-1, 4),
    expand = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_fill_discrete(
    labels = c("Deals", "Valuation", "Dilution")
  ) +
  labs(
    title    = "Funding Growth Decomposition",
    x        = element_blank(),
    y        = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1, 4)) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25)
  )
```

## Algebra II

* "Price adjust" venture funding: \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){\textbf{divide by valuation}}}
  - Analogous to adjusting nominal GDP with inflation to get real GDP

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("decomp-2.png")
```

\begin{tikzpicture}[tpstyle]
	\draw[pencil,very thick] ([yshift=-2pt]node2.south west) to ([yshift=-2pt]node2.south east);			
\end{tikzpicture}

## \"Real\" Funding Growth is Slower Than You Think

* A decade of \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){zero real growth}} in late-stage funding activity until the bonanza of 2021

```{r}
ggplot(melt(data_yr[, c("year", "series", "capital_ldl", "capital_adj_ldl")], measure = patterns("_ldl")), aes(x = year, y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = variable)) +
  facet_wrap(~series, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks   = seq(2010, 2022, 4),
    expand   = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(-1, 4, 1),
    limits = c(-1, 4),
    expand = c(0,0)
  ) +
  scale_color_discrete(
    labels = c("Funding Volume", "Adj. Funding Volume")
  ) +
  labs(
    title    = "Growth in Raw vs Valuation-Adjusted Funding Volume",
    x        = element_blank(),
    y        = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1, 3)) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25),
  )
```

	\draw[pencil,very thick] ([yshift=-2pt]node2.south west) to ([yshift=-2pt]node2.south east);			
\end{tikzpicture}

# The Great Venture Recession

## The Comedown

* Deal activity is \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){down 50-70\%}} from its all-time high

```{r}
ggplot(data[time >= as.Date("2020-06-30"), lapply(.SD, \(x) x / max(x) - 1), .SDcol = c("nasdaq", "deals"), by = .(series)]) +
  geom_line(aes(x = data[time >= as.Date("2020-06-30"), time, by = series]$time, y = nasdaq, color = "Nasdaq")) +

  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100),
    limits = c(-0.8, 0)
  ) +
  scale_color_discrete(
    labels = c("Nasdaq", "Deal Count")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Deal Activity Relative to Peak",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Relative to Peak"
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25),
  )
```

\begin{tikzpicture}[tpstyle]
	\draw[pencil,very thick] ([yshift=-2pt]node2.south west) to ([yshift=-2pt]node2.south east);			
\end{tikzpicture}

## Descent from the Peak

* Private valuations are \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){down 30-60\%}} from their peak

```{r}
ggplot(data[time >= as.Date("2020-06-30"), lapply(.SD, \(x) x / max(x) - 1), .SDcol = c("nasdaq", "valuation"), by = .(series)]) +

\end{tikzpicture}

## The Path to Recovery

* Deal activity and valuations decline for 3-5 Quarters, **2-3 years for full recovery**

```{r, include=FALSE}

## Economics 101

* A simple but powerful model: \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){\textbf{supply and demand}}}
  - **Demand:** When everyone wants to buy the same thing, quantities and prices both rise
  - **Supply:** When everyone wants to sell the same thing, quantities rise but prices fall

```{r fig.show = "hold", out.width = "30%"}

## Two Peas in a Pod?

* Deal activity and valuations grow together
  - \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){\textbf{Warning:}}} This doesn't necessarily mean much
  - Need to detrend both variables first, otherwise correlations are meaningless

```{r, fig.dim=c(6, 2.35)}

## Bucking the Trend

* Deal activity and valuations fluctuate together, suggesting demand matters most

```{r}
ggplot(na.omit(data[, .(series, time, deals_l_c, valuation_l_c)])) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = time, y = deals_l_c, color = "Deals"), se = FALSE, span = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = time, y = valuation_l_c, color = "Valuation"), se = FALSE, span = 0.2) +

## Correlation Implies Inflation

* Across most stages, financing activity and valuations are positively correlated

```{r}
ggplot(na.omit(data[, .(series, time, deals_valuation_roll_cor)])) +
  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = deals_valuation_roll_cor, color = series)) +
  facet_wrap(~series, scale = "free") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-1, 1)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Correlation Over Time Between Deal Count and Valuation",
    x = NULL,
    y = "3Y Rolling Correlation"
  ) +
  theme_preso + 
  theme(
    legend.position = "none"
  )
```

## Supply and Demand

* Can we explain the last decade of venture growth in terms of supply and demand?
  - When demand changes, quantities and prices \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){move together}}
  - When supply shifts, quantities and prices \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node3){move in opposite directions}}

* Attribute growth each quarter to demand or supply depending on how deal activity and valuations co-move; cumulate to get the full historical decomposition

```{r fig.show = "hold", out.width = "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("supply_demand2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("supply_demand3.png")
```

\begin{tikzpicture}[tpstyle]
	\draw[pencil,very thick] ([yshift=-2pt]node2.south west) to ([yshift=-2pt]node2.south east);
	\draw[pencil,very thick,brick] ([yshift=-2pt]node3.south west) to ([yshift=-2pt]node3.south east);
\end{tikzpicture}

## We Don't Have Nearly Enough Startups

* Demand accounts for majority of growth in deal activity

```{r}
ggplot(effects_deals, aes(fill = variable, y = value, x = date)) +
  geom_area(position = "stack", aes(color = variable)) +
  facet_wrap(~series, scales = "free") + 
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0, 0),
    date_labels = "%Y",
    date_breaks = "2 years"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-1.25, 2.5)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Growth Decomposition of Deal Activity",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25),
  )
```

## We Value Your Business

* Demand drove most of the increase in venture valuations

```{r}
ggplot(effects_valuation, aes(fill = variable, y = value, x = date)) +
  geom_area(position = "stack", aes(color = variable)) +
  facet_wrap(~series, scales = "free") + 
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0, 0),
    date_labels = "%Y",
    date_breaks = "2 years"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-1, 3.5)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Growth Decomposition of Valuations",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Cumulative Log Growth"
  ) +
  theme_preso +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25),
  )
```

# Conclusion

## Conclusion

* Surging investor demand for the venture asset class drove the increase in deal activity and valuations over the last decade

* More startups than ever before, but this seems to be a **reaction to cheap and plentiful capital** rather than attractive market opportunities
  - Ideally, venture activity should reflect growing capacity and ability of entrepreneurs to start successful new businesses
  - If venture activity merely reflects investors needing increasingly speculative places to park money, we have a big problem

* The demand side got a bit ahead of itself; \tikz[tstyle]{\node[nstyle](node2){it's time for the supply side to catch up}}
